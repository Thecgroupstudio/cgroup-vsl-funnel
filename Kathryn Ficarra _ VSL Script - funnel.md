Well, it's actually quite simple…

Over my 20-year career climbing from manager to VP…

Weeks… Or even days…

**\[WE NEED STRONGER FRAMING ON THE CASE STUDIES\]**

It's all possible thanks to a revolutionary discovery…

That I'm about to share with you…

A discovery that has nothing to do with memorizing scripts…

Or practicing power poses…

Or pretending to be someone you're not…

And everything to do with understanding what I call…

Nervous System Control. 

See, here's what I discovered during my two decades in corporate leadership…

The reason you freeze up in important moments…

The reason you second-guess yourself…

The reason you feel like an imposter…

Has nothing to do with your skills or qualifications…

It's because traditional leadership training teaches you to lead from your head…

But executive presence comes from your body…

Specifically, your nervous system.

When you're triggered in a meeting…

When someone challenges you…

When you're presenting to senior leadership…

Your nervous system goes into survival mode…

Fight, flight, freeze, or fawn…

And you literally can't access your intelligence…

Your confidence…

Or your authentic power…

No amount of communication training can fix this…

Because it's happening at a biological level…

Below your conscious awareness…

But when you learn to regulate your nervous system…

Stay calm under pressure…

And lead from a grounded, centered place…

Everything changes…

People listen when you speak…

They trust your decisions…

They see you as leadership material…

And opportunities start flowing to you…

That's the real secret to executive presence…

It's not what you say or how you stand…

It's the internal state you're operating from…

And if you stay with me to the very end…

I'll show you how to regulate your nervous system in real time…

So you can start building unshakable executive presence fast… 

And take your career to the next level. 

But first, let me introduce myself.

Hi, I'm Kathryn Ficarra.

And for the last 6 years…

I've been helping high-achieving leaders…

Get the promotions and salary increases they deserve…

I have over 20 years of experience at the VP level…

Across startups, gaming, and e-commerce…

I've worked with leaders from Starbucks to Disney…

Spoken at DreamWorks and Women in Tech events…

And been featured in Authority Magazine, Apple TV, and Cosmopolitan…

I've helped hundreds of executives break through to the next level…

But my path to discovering this wasn't easy.

During my corporate career…

I experienced firsthand what it's like to be trapped in survival mode…

Despite having all the qualifications on paper…

I was working 70-hour weeks…

Living on adrenaline and caffeine…

Having panic attacks before big presentations…

I felt like a fraud despite my track record…

And my career had hit a ceiling…

I kept getting feedback that I needed "more executive presence"…

But no one could tell me what that actually meant…

I was making good money but I knew I was capable of more…

I could see less experienced people getting promoted around me…

While I stayed stuck at the same level…

Working harder but not getting ahead…

The worst part was the constant anxiety…

I'd replay every conversation…

Second-guess every decision…

And feel exhausted from trying to prove myself every single day…

I was successful on the outside but miserable on the inside…

Until I discovered something that changed everything.

I realized the problem wasn't my skills…

It wasn't my experience…

It wasn't even my confidence…

The problem was that I was trying to lead from survival mode…

Instead of from a place of power…

My nervous system was constantly activated…

Which made me reactive instead of responsive…

Anxious instead of authoritative…

Scattered instead of strategic…

So I invested over $150,000…

And years of my life…

Learning from the world's top experts…

In neuroscience, psychology, and somatic therapy…

To figure out how to regulate my nervous system…

Calm my internal state…

And lead from a centered, grounded place…

And once I cracked the code…

Everything changed.

Not only did I feel authentic for the first time in years…

But my entire approach to leadership transformed…

I stopped working from anxiety and started leading from clarity…

I could handle any challenge without getting rattled…

I went on to launch my own business…

Now I'm paid premium rates for my expertise…

Because people can sense the difference…

Between someone who's performing confidence…

And someone who truly embodies it…

And then something unexpected happened…

Leaders started reaching out to me…

Asking how I made the transformation…

They were dealing with similar issues to the ones I had faced myself…

They were getting passed over for promotions…

Feeling invisible in meetings…

Working hard but not getting recognized…

Knowing they were capable of more but unable to break through…

So I started sharing what I'd learned…

And to my amazement, it worked for them too…

Over and over again…

I saw the same pattern…

Smart, hardworking leaders…

Who were stuck at their current level…

Were able to get promoted…

Increase their salaries…

And finally get the recognition they deserved…

By learning to regulate their nervous system…

And lead from a place of inner calm and strength…

Pretty soon, word spread…

I was speaking at major events…

Coaching VPs and Directors…

Helping leaders across industries…

All using this same revolutionary approach…

And now, I want to share it with you…

At my Executive Presence Immersion…

July 20th through 23rd…

At the Sanctuary Beach Resort in Monterey, California…

Now you're probably wondering…

What exactly is this approach?

How does it work?

And how can you use it to finally get the promotion and salary you deserve?

Great question.

Let me break it down for you…

The traditional approach to executive presence is completely backwards…

They focus on surface-level techniques…

How to stand…

How to speak…

How to dress…

But they ignore what's happening inside your body…

Your nervous system…

Your stress response…

Your internal state…

That's why you can practice power poses all day…

But still freeze up when your boss challenges you in a meeting…

You can memorize communication frameworks…

But still stumble over your words when presenting to the C-suite…

You can work on your body language…

But still feel anxious and shaky inside…

My approach is different.

I start with your nervous system.

Because here's what I discovered…

When your nervous system is regulated…

When you're operating from a calm, centered state…

Executive presence happens naturally.

You speak with authority because you feel authoritative…

You command respect because you respect yourself…

You make decisions with confidence because you trust your judgment…

But most people are trying to build executive presence…

While their nervous system is in chaos…

It's like trying to give a presentation during an earthquake…

No matter how good your content is…

You're going to shake.

You won’t be able to speak clearly…

And you’re not going to command attention… 

So step one is always nervous system regulation.

Once you learn to stay calm under pressure…

Then we can work on the other elements…

Like how you think about yourself as a leader…

How you communicate your ideas…

How you handle conflict and challenges…

How you show up in high-stakes situations…

This is why I created what I call the IMPACT process…

It's a systematic approach to building unshakable executive presence…

Starting with your nervous system…

And working outward from there…

IMPACT stands for:

Identity Alignment…  
Mindset Mastery…  
Persona Integration…  
Authority and Confidence…  
Communication Excellence…  
And Transformative Growth…

And it’s geared towards regulating and calming your nervous system…

So you can command executive presence naturally… 

Step one is Identity Alignment…

Here, we get crystal clear on who you are as a leader…

What you stand for…

What you bring to the table…

And why you deserve to be in senior leadership…

Most people struggle with executive presence because they don't truly believe they belong…

They feel like impostors…

So they show up tentatively…

Apologetically…

Which signals to everyone else that they're not leadership material…

Because how you feel is the energetic conversation you’re having without saying a word…

People actually absorb your insecurities…

But when you align with your true identity as a leader…

And you're operating from a regulated nervous system…

You show up with natural authority…

People can sense it immediately…

And they start treating you differently…

Step two is Mindset Mastery…

This is where we reprogram the limiting beliefs that trigger your nervous system…

*Like "I'm not senior leadership material"…*

*Or "I need to work twice as hard to get half the recognition"…*

These unconscious beliefs are what cause your nervous system to activate…

They make you feel threatened when you should feel confident…

They make you doubt yourself when you should be decisive…

We identify these patterns…

Understand where they came from…

And replace them with empowering beliefs that keep you regulated and strong…

Step three is Persona Integration…

This is where you embody the next version of yourself…

The leader who commands multiple six-figure salaries…

Who gets promoted to the C-suite…

Who influences at the highest levels…

We define exactly who that person is…

How they think…

How they speak…

How they carry themselves…

Then we integrate that persona into your nervous system…

So it becomes your natural way of being…

Not something you have to think about or perform…

Steps four through six cover Authority, Communication…

And Transformative Growth…

Where you learn to speak with conviction…

Handle conflict with confidence…

And maintain your regulated state long-term…

So you keep advancing in your career…

Year after year…

Now here's what makes this different from everything else out there…

Most programs teach you to fake it till you make it…

I teach you to regulate first, then embody…

Most focus on external behaviors…

I start with your internal state…

Most give you scripts and techniques…

I help you access your authentic power through nervous system mastery…

The result?

Confidence that doesn't waver under pressure…

Authority that people respect naturally…

Leadership presence that opens doors…

And career acceleration that feels inevitable…

Just imagine what that would feel like…

Walking into any boardroom with your nervous system completely calm…

Speaking up and having everyone listen…

Because your energy commands attention…

Presenting your ideas with complete confidence…

Because you're not fighting internal anxiety…

Handling challenges without getting rattled…

Because you know how to stay regulated…

Getting promoted ahead of schedule because your presence is undeniable…

Negotiating salary increases successfully…

Because you feel your worth in your bones…

Being headhunted for executive roles…

Because leaders can sense your authentic power…

And finally earning what you're worth…

Because you embody leadership from the inside out…

This is what becomes possible…

When you develop real executive presence…

Through nervous system regulation…

And that’s what I’m going to show you at the Executive Presence Immersion.

The best part is…

We're bringing in world-class experts…
