        <h1>Your Presence Is Your Power</h1>
        <h2>Executive presence isn’t about commanding the room. It’s about knowing who you are before you enter it.</h2>

        <h2>Welcome Letter from Kathryn</h2>
        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <p>If you’re reading this, chances are you’re craving more than just another leadership tactic.</p>
        <p>You’ve probably achieved a lot. Maybe you’ve climbed the ranks, hit milestones, built a life that looks successful from the outside… and yet something still feels off.</p>
        <p>You’re showing up, but you’re not being seen.<br>
        You’re speaking, but you’re not being heard.<br>
        You’re leading, but it’s draining instead of fulfilling.</p>
        <p>I know that feeling—because I lived it.</p>
        <p>For over 20 years, I was a high-achieving executive, leading teams across industries, collecting titles and checking all the boxes. But inside, I was disconnected. I thought presence meant “performance”—so I kept pushing, proving, and perfecting. Until my body said no. My soul said no. And I finally listened.</p>
        <p>This book isn’t just about executive presence. It’s about reclaiming the parts of you that got lost in the performance. It’s about remembering that your power was never outside of you. And it’s about learning how to walk into any room anchored, aligned, and unshakably you.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to be louder to be heard.<br>
        You don’t need to be someone else to be respected.<br>
        You just need to come home to yourself.</p>
        <p>In the pages ahead, I’ll walk you through the six internal shifts that changed everything for me—and for the leaders I now coach. These shifts are rooted in neuroscience, embodiment, and lived experience. They’re not quick fixes. They’re deep recalibrations.</p>
        <p>I’m honored you’re here. And I hope this work helps you remember what’s always been true:</p>
        <div class="quote">Your presence is your power.</div>
        <p>With purpose,<br>Kathryn</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Identity & Alignment – Who You Are</div>
        <div class="quote">“Before you can lead others with presence, you have to know who you are when no one is watching.”</div>
        <p>We spend so much of our professional lives trying to become what others expect—the competent one, the strong one, the fixer, the closer, the team player. And somewhere along the way, we lose track of ourselves.</p>
        <p>We trade authenticity for approval. Power for performance. Presence for perfection.</p>
        <p>But executive presence isn’t about image. It’s about alignment. It’s about what happens internally before you ever say a word.</p>
        <p>Most people lead from their title, not their truth. But leadership that lasts comes from congruence—when who you are, what you value, and how you show up all point in the same direction.</p>
        <p>This is the foundation of presence. And without it? Everything feels off. People might follow you, but they don’t feel you. And eventually, neither do you.</p>
        <p>Here’s how misalignment might show up:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You say yes when your gut says no</li>
            <li>You shrink in rooms where you should lead</li>
            <li>You question your decisions after making them</li>
            <li>You feel two steps behind yourself all the time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This isn’t a personal flaw. It’s a byproduct of leading from the outside in.</p>
        <p>Let’s flip the paradigm. Instead of “What do I need to be today?”, ask: “Who am I when I’m not performing?”</p>
        <p>Because the most magnetic leaders aren’t trying to be someone—they’re grounded in who they already are.</p>
        <p>They’ve done the inner work to know their core identity, and they make decisions from that place of clarity.</p>
        <div class="tool"><strong>TOOL: The Leadership Mirror</strong><br>
        Use these prompts to get clear on who you are—beyond the résumé.
        <ol>
            <li>What are my non-negotiable values as a leader?<br>→ When I honor these, I feel like myself. When I don’t, I feel off.</li>
            <li>What’s the deeper mission I care about?<br>→ Beyond performance, what am I here to embody and activate in others?</li>
            <li>What version of myself am I ready to retire?<br>→ Think of a way of being that no longer serves you (people-pleaser, perfectionist, over-worker).</li>
            <li>What truth have I been afraid to say out loud—but know is mine?</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="prompt"><strong>PRESENCE PROMPT:</strong><br>“When my identity and my behavior are in alignment, I feel...”</div>
        <div class="final-thought"><strong>FINAL THOUGHT:</strong><br>When you know who you are, you stop chasing your worth. And the room begins to shift around you—not because you’re louder… but because you’re finally in alignment.</div>
