# Executive Presence Immersion Program - Email Automation Overview

## What We're Building

We're creating an automated email journey that guides potential clients from their first interaction with your brand through to program enrollment. This sequence ensures no prospect falls through the cracks and maintains consistent, professional communication.

## How It Works (In Plain English)

1. **Initial Contact**: When someone submits your form, they automatically receive a welcome email confirming their information was received and prompting them to schedule a call.

2. **Booking Process**: 
   - If they don't book a call within 24 hours, they receive a gentle reminder
   - When they book through Calendly, your system automatically logs this and sends them a confirmation email with call details
   - They receive a reminder 24 hours before the scheduled call

3. **After the Call**:
   - Interested prospects receive details about the program, pricing, and a time-limited offer
   - Those not ready to commit receive nurturing content to keep them engaged
   - A reminder is sent before any special offer expires

4. **Payment Confirmation**:
   - When payment is processed through Stripe, they receive a receipt and welcome information

## Technical Integration (Simplified)

- **Form Submission ‚Üí n8n**: Your website form already connects to n8n for processing
- **Calendly ‚Üí n8n**: Your booking system already logs appointments in n8n
- **Stripe ‚Üí n8n**: This connection needs to be established to track payments

## What Makes This Valuable

1. **No Manual Follow-up Required**: The system handles all communication timing automatically

2. **Professional Consistency**: Every prospect receives the same high-quality communication

3. **Increased Conversion**: Timely reminders and follow-ups capture prospects who might otherwise drop off

4. **Executive-Level Communication**: All emails are professionally designed with your branding and use language appropriate for your executive audience

5. **Complete Visibility**: You'll know exactly where each prospect is in their journey
