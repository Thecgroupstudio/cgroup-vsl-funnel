# Funnel Foundations

<aside>
<img src="/icons/library_green.svg" alt="/icons/library_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Funnel Foundations**

In this video, we’re going to cover the core foundations of funnels. I’ll show you the mistakes people make when building funnels, what you actually should be doing when building a funnel and how to ensure that you have the most success possible.

</aside>

**The Big Mistakes 🙅‍♂️**

There are **3 main mistakes** that most people make when building funnels:

1. They blindly copy & paste someone else’s funnel.
2. They make the funnel as complex as humanly possible.
3. They’re constantly jumping from funnel to funnel. 

In order to be successful you need to do the **complete opposite** of this. The most successful funnels I’ve built and that I’ve seen in the market are ****simple, boring & efficient. 

They’re not a Manychat funnel that has 67 automations with an AI butler who serves the prospect dinner—they’re **simple funnels** (webinar/VSL/etc) that have been **executed well**. 

The **best funnels** I’ve built and seen are: 

1. Designed for the psychology of a specific person / market. 
2. Extremely simple funnels with limited complexity. 
3. Hyper-optimized via 1,000+ hours of relentless testing. 

**The Real Question 🤔**

I want you to take a second to think about a question:

<aside>
<img src="/icons/thought-dialogue_blue.svg" alt="/icons/thought-dialogue_blue.svg" width="40px" /> Why do you even have a funnel?

</aside>

Really think about this question for a second. 
**
If you go into the supermarket and you buy eggs, or you buy protein powder from Amazon, there’s **no VSL, no webinar, no funnel, no sales call**—why?

The reason is because when you buy these products you’re already in a **“buying state”** meaning you already have all of **the beliefs necessary to buy** the product. 

If we could run an ad that said “click here and buy my course for $8,000” we would do that, but we can’t because the prospect **isn’t in the buying pocket** yet—you need to build those beliefs.  ****

**Examples:** 

- I bought liposomal Vitamin C from Amazon
- I bought a key light from Amazon for YouTube videos

**I didn’t watch a sales video** from the brand on either of these. For the key light, I watched some YouTube videos from influencers to find **the best option** for me. 

I already **knew I had a problem**, the problem was **painful enough** to solve for $300, I knew I wanted a **specific type of solution**, I just did some quick comparisons on the best option. 

The customer needs to believe, consciously or subconsciously, that:

1. They have a **problem**;
2. They want the **end result** of solving the problem;
3. That your **solution** is the best way to solve it; 
4. That your **product** is the best option for them to do that.

![The f (41).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/e77d0799-a37a-4b25-bee7-4a6e83f3fd82/The_f_(41).png)

We’re leveraging **pre-existing pain & desire** in the prospect’s mind (what they want) and building belief that **our solution** is the way to **get what they want**. 

This is why: 

1. Copy-pasting a funnel blindly won’t work **→ 🧠 speak to the market**
2. Chasing the next shiny object funnel won’t work **→ ⏰ discover the desires**

Let’s look at a few more examples…

<aside>
<img src="/icons/thought-dialogue_blue.svg" alt="/icons/thought-dialogue_blue.svg" width="40px" /> **Market:** Upper and upper-middle class people who are stressed & health conscious

- **Unaware →** Vaguely aware that something is wrong, but not identified as “anxiety”
- **Problem Aware →** I feel anxious and stressed when working long hours
- **Desire Aware →** I want to feel calm and relaxed without addictive medication
- **Solution Aware →** Ashwagandha is highly effective at reducing anxiety & stress
- **Product Aware →** Clinically-proven KSM66™ is the most effective form
</aside>

People make decisions on 2 primary vectors—**price and value** (value is based on what they get and price is what they pay). Usually it will be **some combination of both**, depending on the specific situation they will decide differently. 

The basic calculus is **“is it worth it?”** — people are looking for **dollars at a discount**.

If you’re selling something very simple and tangible, like laundry detergent, then all of the pre-existing marketing has already been done to the point where you can simply place your laundry detergent in the shopping aisle, give a great deal, and people will buy it. 

Because: 

1. They know that they have a problem (**dirty laundry**)
2. They want a better future (**clean laundry**)
3. They know that they need your solution (**washing detergent**)
4. They know they want your product (price/packaging/etc.)

<aside>
<img src="/icons/thought_blue.svg" alt="/icons/thought_blue.svg" width="40px" /> The point of a funnel is to take someone from where they are now—usually **unaware,** **problem aware or solution aware**—and installing the beliefs that they need to have in order to become buyer capable for your program.

</aside>

You need to take them all the way from their **current level of belief** to a **product aware belief**. In other words, you need to install the beliefs necessary for them to be **buyer capable**. 

That is what your funnel is there for. It is a **persuasion tool**. 

It’s designed to take some from knowing that they have a **problem** (or perhaps even NOT knowing they have a problem) to desiring your specific **program**, using persuasive tools. 

We will be going over **how to do that** more deeply in coming videos. 

**The Key To Funnels 🔑**

The **key to a successful funnel** is:

1. Promising the person what they **want in their heart of hearts**.
2. Creating belief that you have the **best/easiest/fastest way** to get it.

It’s no more complicated than that. If you can do this, your funnel will **print money**. 

In order to do this, you need to **understand your market** and what their deepest desires are. What do they want in their words? How can you promise them exactly what they want? 
****

![The f (38).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/415ee648-6cc6-4610-baff-9afcdfd21902/The_f_(38).png)

Imagine if we tried to pitch you Client Control as a **“passive income” opportunity** and started talking about a step by step framework to make $5k/month online passively.  

It would not have worked, because you don’t want that. 

Instead, we promise you **clients & increased revenue** and build belief that the way for you to get there is using **our specific ad strategies, funnels, etc.** Make sense? 

What you want to do is **hammer this the entire way through the funnel** to build this belief consistently throughout the entire funnel. 

![The f (37).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/aaf930f0-8c69-4a8e-8fcb-13e0b9c4d0f4/389137a2-25e1-4c18-b26f-8129f8de9467.png)

The big mistake I see people making is they **diverge dramatically** from the prospect’s **core desire** throughout the funnel and they don’t maintain a straight line. 

![The f (39).png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/e153103f-92a7-4af5-9bbf-6267fd5ccd14/The_f_(39).png)

The way to figure out what the market wants is by **making lots of ads**, figuring out **what the market wants**, then we’re **optimizing our funnel** around what the market is responding to. 

Once we actually start seeing the messages people are **opting in for** and we start seeing the ads they're **responding to** and we look at the CPLs—then we can really start dialing in **exactly what they want in their heart of hearts** and making a really lethal message.

**Summary ✍️**

- Avoid blindly copying and pasting someone else’s funnel.
- Keep the funnel simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Stick with one funnel and avoid constantly jumping to new ones.
- Design the funnel to target the psychology of a specific person or market.
- Focus on building simple, efficient funnels optimized through extensive testing.
- A funnel’s role is to build the necessary beliefs to make a prospect buyer capable.
- Ensure the funnel aligns with the core desires of the target market.
- Ensure your funnel maintains a consistent message from start to finish.
- Continuously optimize the funnel based on what the market responds to.
- Create your diamond map so you know what beliefs you need to build.




# VSL Call Funnel

<aside>
<img src="/icons/preview_green.svg" alt="/icons/preview_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to VSL Call Funnel**

In this video, we’ll cover what a VSL call funnel is and give you an overview of the pages in the funnel so that you know what’s coming next. Let’s get started.

</aside>

**What Is A VSL Call Funnel?**

A **VSL Call Funnel** is a structured series of landing pages designed to persuade the prospect to **book a call** using a video sales letter (**VSL**). 

This funnel consists of **four main pages**, which I’ll explain below. 

**1. Opt-In Page 🙋‍♂️**

The first page in the funnel is the **opt-in page**. This page includes a **headline**, a **sub-headline**, and a **picture of you or screenshot of your VSL**. The goal is to get the person to **opt-in**.

**Example →** https://go.hyperscalelabs.com/opt-in-example 

**2. VSL Page 🎥**

Once prospects **submit their information**, they are directed to a **thank you page** containing an embedded video—**this is your VSL**. 

The VSL is there to **persuade prospects** to **schedule a call**. Below the video, there is a button that directs them to the **calendar page**.

**Example →** https://go.hyperscalelabs.com/vsl-example

As you know, we’re going to **script the VSL for you**. You can expect the VSL to be anywhere from **10 to 20 minutes** in length. 

**3. Calendar Page 📆**

On the **calendar page**, prospects can schedule a call and **answer a series of questions** about their situation. These questions provide you with **background information** before the call. 

A common question I get is **whether or not** to include **strong qualifying questions** to filter out prospects who might not be a good fit. 

**The answer is no** (at least not initially). 
****
This approach should **only** be used when you have **more calls than you or your sales team can handle**—until then you should be taking ALL the booked calls and gathering data. 

Why? People sometimes provide information that doesn’t fully reflect their financial situation. 

For example, we had a **stay-at-home mom** recently sign up for a call. She indicated an income of **$0 to $1k a month**. We could have canceled that call, assuming she couldn't afford our program. 

However, it turned out her husband was making **$4 million a year**, meaning she had plenty of financial resources to invest in our program. 

**Over-qualifying** will lead to **missing out on prospects** who are actually a perfect fit, even if their form responses suggest otherwise. It’s essential to **take every call without assumptions**, regardless of the information provided (at least initially).

**Example →** https://go.hyperscalelabs.com/schedule-example 

**4. Success Page ✅**

After booking a call, prospects are redirected to a **pre-call preparation page**. This page includes a video that provides **instructions on what to do before the call**. 

Below the video, you should list **testimonials**, **case studies**, and **client results** to build additional trust and **pre-sell the prospect** before the call. 

The goal here is to **handle as many objections as possible** before the actual conversation.

In addition to the funnel pages, it’s crucial to have a few **follow-up emails** that direct people back to the VSL or encourage them to book a call if they haven’t already. Later in the training, we'll cover **how to create this email sequence** in both the **direct** and **indirect VSL** sections.

**Example →** https://go.hyperscalelabs.com/success-example

**Objective 🎯**

The primary objective of this funnel is to get someone to **book a call** in your calendar and show up to the call, with **some level of buying intent**.  

They should have a clear understanding of **what you can do for them**, that you have been **getting other people results** and that you have a **unique methodology** to get them results.

You should have also started to dial up the **desire or pain** associated with your offer or solution. 

During the sales call, your job is to continue **building the pain**, **increasing their desire** for your solution, and **reinforcing their belief** that your offer is exactly what they need right now. 

You’ll then **present your offer** and **close them into your program**.

**Summary ✍️**

- The opt-in page is the first page of a VSL funnel, where you capture the prospect’s email.
- They will then hit a VSL page where they’ll watch a sales video & be prompted to book a call.
- The next page is a calendar page where the prospect can book a call with you or your team.
- Finally, the prospect will see a thank-you video that will prepare them for the call.
- During this process, we send the prospect emails to drive them towards booking a call.

# VSL Script (B2B)

<aside>
<img src="/icons/script_green.svg" alt="/icons/script_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome To VSL Script (B2B)**

In this video, we’re going to break down the VSL script that we’ll use to write your VSL. I’ll break down each step of the VSL script and provide you with a plug & play template you can use to write your VSL. Let’s get into it.

</aside>

**The Script 📝**

Below is the **script** that we’re going to be using for the **VSL video**. Below, I’ve provided an **example** VSL script with a breakdown on how it works. 

**Important →** This is the B2B and B2Solopreneur script! Do not use this if you’re B2C. 
****

1. State Offer
2. Expand with 3 key results
3. Provide Social Proof
4. First CTA
5. Mechanism
6. Social proof 
7. Second CTA

**Example #1 → [My VSL (HSL)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCygNIV0qVwYFFVMdHXddTppP5KoSroZVB8c3HrKPEk/edit)**

**Example #2 → [Client Control Variation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNQCE5MI4L7oDt6XZGeoINUGEnxTV8GYiIf-BIJXS28/edit)

Template 📋**

<aside>
✍️ **[Target Market]**—we’ll **[get you a specific big result]** in **[timeframe]** using **[method]** or **[risk reversal]**!

Basically, our company will guarantee you three key results.

#1 – We’ll **[get you first micro-result along the way to the big result]**…

****Our **[mechanism]** has **[credibility]**. ****Which is why it will **[get** **you superior outcome]**. So if you want **[outcome]**, ****we’ll give you **[solution]** so you can **[benefit]** and ultimately **[benefit of that benefit]**.

****#2 – We’ll **[get you second micro-result along the way to the big result]**…

****Our **[mechanism]** has **[credibility]**. ****Which is why it will **[get** **you superior outcome]**. So if you want **[outcome]**, ****we’ll give you **[solution]** so you can **[benefit]** and ultimately **[benefit of that benefit].**  

#3 — And finally, we’ll **[get you third micro-result along the way to the big result]**…

People tell me all the time they want **[big desire]** but they **[experience problem]**—guarantee that we’ll **[solve problem]** using **[mechanism]** and get you **[outcome]**. 

****And again—we guarantee those results. So if you don’t **[get outcome]** in **[timeframe]** then **[risk reversal]**. Now obviously, you have to hold up your end of the agreement to qualify for the guarantee. More on that later. 

Now you’re probably wondering, how can he/she even do that? And the reason is, because we get results. We’ve helped **[target market] [achieve result]** over and over and over again consistently and predictably… 

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. 

**[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. 

**[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

So if that’s all you need to hear and you want to speak with my team, book a call below and we’ll demo with you how this works. And we have no incentive to sell you on anything because again, if it doesn’t work, **[risk reversal]**.

Now, if you want to know WHY this works so well, let me show you. 

The second reason is **[reason]**. 

See, when most people **[try to solve problem]** they make **[mistake]** which leads to **[problem]** and ultimately **[big problem].** 

Instead, we **[take opposite or alternative approach]** which leads to **[micro-outcome]** and ultimately makes it easy to **[big outcome]**, because **[reason why]**. 

The reason this works so well is because **[proof or credibility]**. See, because **[credibility]** we **[have unique advantage]**—resulting in **[benefit for prospect]**. 

Make sense? 

The second reason is **[reason]**. 

See, when most people **[try to solve problem]** they make **[mistake]** which leads to **[problem]** and ultimately **[big problem].** 

Instead, we **[take opposite or alternative approach]** which leads to **[micro-outcome]** and ultimately makes it easy to **[big outcome]**, because **[reason why]**. 

The reason this works so well is because **[proof or credibility]**. See, because **[credibility]** we **[have unique advantage]**—resulting in **[benefit for prospect]**. 

Imagine for a second if you never had to worry about **[problem]** again. Imagine if you woke up in the morning and **[future pacing]**… and instead of **[pain point]** you simply experienced **[desired outcome]**…

****How would that feel? Pretty good, right?

And again, this isn’t just a pipe dream. This is a reality for many of our clients. 

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. 

**[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. 

**[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

Which is why we’re able to put our money where our mouth is and guarantee you such strong results. So again, if you work with us and you don’t **[achieve specific outcome]** in **[timeframe]**—we’ll **[risk reversal]**. 

If you want to get a live demo of this, go below this video and schedule a call right now and our team will walk you through everything that you need to see, step-by-step. So again, this has been **[name]**—and thanks for watching. 
****

**Summary ✍️**

- Use the VSL script outlined above to script your VSL.
- Re-read the example VSL script provided & apply each component.
- Remember to make your mechanism easy to apply & push-button.

# VSL Script (B2C)

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_green.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome To VSL Script (B2C)**

In this video, we’re going to break down the VSL script for B2C offers. I’ll show you how it differs from the B2B script and how to write it for your business, so you can start booking more calls and getting more clients.

</aside>

**Prelude 💭**

If you haven’t, please go ahead and watch the **B2B** VSL script video. 

You **won’t be using that script**, but you’ll be using a **slight variation** on it. Plus, it covers a lot of really important points on the **mechanics of the VSL** that you need to be aware of. 

So if you haven’t seen that—**please watch it now**. 
 ****

**Script Breakdown 📑**

The **script below** is the **ideal script** for B2C offers. We’ll go through it together now and break down the **components of the script** and how to **fill it in successfully** to make it as effective as possible for your offer. 

Once that’s done, we’ll get it **submitted to our coaches**, who will finalize it and **clean it up for you**, so you can set it live and **start getting appointments and clients**. 

<aside>
✍️ If you're **[in situation]** and want **[big desire]**, then listen up. 

We will help you **[get outcome]** in **[short time frame]** guaranteed or we **[risk reversal]**. Meaning, if in the next **[timeframe]**, we don't help you **[get outcome]**, then **[risk reversal]**. And the best part is, our **[name of system]** doesn’t require **[things you hate]**—in fact, we do the complete opposite. And we actually use a method you’ve probably never seen or heard of before, which I’ll talk about in a minute. 

And the best part is—it actually works. Look at this.

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. **[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

**[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. **[Client name]** went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

And again, we're not going to try and hard sell you on joining us. Because ultimately, if we can't get you results, then **[risk reversal]**. So we're only taking on people we know we can actually help. 

Now, if you want to know more details about how this **[system name]** works, in the next 90 seconds, I'm going to give you a full inside look into how we're able to take everyday **[market]** and help them **[get result]**, without **[objections]** so they can **[benefit]** and **[benefit of the benefit]**.

Look, here’s the truth. Anyone can **[get desired outcome]** if they know how. So why isn’t everyone doing it? Why are you still struggling with **[problem]**? I want to tell you right now, it’s not your fault. It’s because of one big lie that gurus in the industry are telling you.

See, you’ve been told that in order to **[get outcome]** you have to **[state the 1st big lie]**, **[2nd big lie]** and **[third big lie]**. But there’s a big problem with that, which is **[explain a logical reason why this doesn’t work]**. And ultimately, this means that you end up with **[problem]**, which leads to **[consequence of the problem]** and **[ultimate consequence of that problem]**. 

This is the sad reality for 99 percent of people who try to **[get outcome]**. And I don't wish the same fate for you. So what do you need? You need a system. One system that is easy to use, that you can spend **[small daily commitment]** on to **[get outcome]**—even if you **[common objection #1]** and **[common objection #2]**. 

So here at **[CompanyName]**, we teach our clients the simplest, easiest way to **[get outcome]** without **[thing #1 you hate]**, **[thing #2 you hate]** and **[thing #3 you hate]**. It’s called the **[name of system]**. It’s battle-tested with **[number of clients]**. 

And here’s how it works. Instead of **[doing what everyone else is]** we simply **[do the opposite of what everyone else is doing OR do something very different]**. And what we do next is **[explain how it works]**. 

Now the reason this works so well is because **[explain why it’s so effective]**. And so what happens is **[you get micro benefit]** and then **[you get bigger result]** and then you **[get the ultimate result they’re looking for]**. Make sense? 

And that’s why we get such consistent, predictable results for our clients. Like **[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, who went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. Or **[Client name]** who went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

 Or **[Client name]**, **[brief description of client]**, who went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** working with us. Or **[Client name]** who went from **[starting point]** to **[success outcome]** in **[time frame]** and is now **[ongoing success outcome]**.

And again, if you work with us and you don't see these results for yourself, then **[risk reversal]**. If this sounds interesting and you finally want to **[get desired result]** and **[experience big benefits in your life]**, then click the link below this video schedule a call with myself and my team. 

And again, we're not going to be incentivized to hard sell you or push you to do something that you don't want to do because at the end of the day, if we can't get your results, then **[risk reversal]**. So click the link below, schedule a call with myself and my team and I cannot wait to make you our next success story.

# VSL Examples

<aside>
<img src="/icons/preview_green.svg" alt="/icons/preview_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome To VSL Examples**

In this video, we’re going to provide examples of VSLs so you can see how they work and how to improve your VSL. We’ll also talk about building a swipe file to use as inspiration when optimizing your VSL. Let’s get started.

</aside>

**Building A Swipe File 🗃**

In order to **improve & optimize** your VSL, you want to start building a **swipe file** of **winning VSLs** that other people on the market are using successfully. 

****The way to do this is by:

1. Watching ads that appear in your feed.
2. Using Vidtao and other ad spy tools. 

****If you see an ad **over and over again** on Meta (or an ad with a lot of views on YouTube) you can **assume that the ad is doing well**. 

Bookmark the funnel and come back to it later to **get inspiration** to test ideas. Don’t just blindly copy their funnel—think about how you can **apply what they’re doing** to **your market**. 

****

**Examples 👇**

**Example #1 →** https://www.conversionsecrets.io/watch 

**Example #2 →** https://www.hyperscalelabs.com/info 

**Example #3 →** https://ecombossmentoring.com/how-it-works/ 

**Summary ✍️**

- Keep your ad blocker off & watch ads in your feed.
- Use spy tools like Vidtao and similar to find winning ads.
- If you see winning ads, bookmark the funnel (especially if direct VSL).

# Filming Your VSL

<aside>
<img src="/icons/video-camera_green.svg" alt="/icons/video-camera_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Filming Your Direct VSL**

In this video, we’re going to talk about how to film your VSL. You’re going to see the recording setup I recommend from cameras to microphones to lighting and more. I’ll show you different options for different budgets.

</aside>

**Resources 📕**

- [The Gear List](https://www.notion.so/The-Gear-List-e12710755fbe4ab0979bbec47a7c642f?pvs=21)

**Warning ⚠️**

Don’t get too hung up on the equipment and buying the right equipment before you shoot. The single **most important** thing is **what you say** in your VSL. 

****Your camera, lighting, etc. **does not need to be perfect** for your VSL to work*.* If the best you can do right now is an **iPhone** with a **lavelier microphone**, do that immediately. 

If you are **easy to see** and **easy to hear** that’s enough to get started. 

**Teleprompter  🦜** 

To reiterate what I said earlier in the program—I would **strongly** **recommend scripting your VSL **word for word** and recording the script with a teleprompter. 

I recommend getting the **Neweer X12** teleprompter (link provided in the gear list). 

When you record, simply **load the script** into the Neweer app on your phone, slide it into the holder that’s attached to the teleprompter, and press play. 

Search for instructions on YT if you need help with this. 

**Lighting 💡**

Lighting is **very important**. ****You don’t want to have **dark videos** where it’s hard to see your face and eyes. This is going to **break trust** and make your VSL look scammy. 

If you can set your desk up in a space that has a lot of **natural light** and your face and eyes are **fully lit up,** that’s great. [**Here’s a video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXe3rEWrDVg) that explains how to get good lighting for your videos. 

I’d start with a **key light & softbox** if you don’t have a tonne of natural light and go from there.

**Audio & Echo 🔊**

If you have *some echo*, it’s not the end of the world but personally, I hate how it sounds. I recommend doing whatever you can (within reason) to **prevent it** and **minimize it**. Getting it out in post-production is **extremely difficult** and it sounds weird when you do. 

Echo is caused by audio bouncing off of **large, hard surfaces** so you want to cover as many of these surfaces as you can with **smaller, softer objects** that will absorb sound (use things like couches, rugs, chairs, tables, desks, etc). 

There’s other things you can do too, like using **sound blankets** and **acoustic panels**. Search “how to remove echo from home office” on YouTube and you’ll see instructional videos. 
****

**Microphone Setup 🎙** 

Personally, I use the **Shure SM7B** microphone with the **Focusrite Scarlett Solo** audio interface. 

- [**Here’s a video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJQplYMJDXI&t=151s) with instructions on how to set up the Scarlett Solo
- [**Here’s another one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6NXB3mWdc) on setting it up in Garageband

Keep in mind that this audio interface **only has one input and output channel**. 

So if you want to do **live podcasts** with **more than one person** at some point, you’ll need a model like the **Scarlett Focusrite 2i2** that has multiple input and output channels. 

The **Shure MV7+** is also a great option and you don’t need an audio interface to run it, you can send the signal directly to your laptop with a **USB-C cable** (saves money on the interface). 

The SM7B is a slightly better microphone, but it’s up to you. 

**Camera Setup 📸** 

Personally, I have a **Sony a7c** and I’m very happy with it. It’s not at the absolute high-end of the market, but it’s an excellent **mid-range camera** that’s very good value for money. 

**Lower End →** Sony a6700

**Mid Range →** Sony a7c

**High End →** Sony FX3

These are all going to get the job done, you’ll just get a better shot as you move up in price. 

For your lens, you want to go with a **24mm lens**. I personally use the **Sony 16-35mm lens** in the Gear List, but it’s up to you where you go here. 

Keep in mind that camera technology will stay up to date for about **5-7 years**, but a lens will last **10-20 years**, as the technology is advancing slower. 

So it makes sense to invest in a good lens.

**Camera Tripod  📷  🎞**

I’d also recommend getting a **good tripod** that can sit on your desk. 

Personally, I’d recommend **against** getting the bendy ones like you see on the left below. I find it **really hard** to adjust it and get it set up right. I personally use [**this one here**](https://www.notion.so/Filming-YouTube-Ads-e331c7d59c9e47bbb14ba03eef7ade61?pvs=21). 

![Untitled design - 2024-07-14T143140.237.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/f5a96d6d-9b5b-4a14-b86c-9977abc3c160/Untitled_design_-_2024-07-14T143140.237.png)

**Recording Application 🔴 🧑🏻‍💻**

You will also need a **recording application** on your computer to record audio with. 

I’ve used Audacity and Garageband (which is Mac only) and found that Audacity was **consistently buggy** so I personally just use **Garageband** now—it works fine and it’s free. 

[**Logic Pro X**](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) is another option you can consider. 

Logic Pro should have **higher quality sound**, but I haven’t tested it so I don’t know if it’s worth the $199. Either way, Garageband works just fine for me. 

****All of these tools are **Mac-only** though. If you have a PC… just, why? **I thought about researching this for you, but as a punishment you’ll have to Google and find this yourself. 

**Recording Time 🎬**

Here’s **the steps** to go through when you sit down to record:

- [ ]  Open Garageband or other recording software
- [ ]  Make sure your microphone is connected
- [ ]  Do a test recording to ensure it’s working
- [ ]  Switch on your camera and remove lens cover
- [ ]  Make sure the background is clean & tidy
- [ ]  Press record on your DAW / recording software
- [ ]  Press record on your camera
- [ ]  Clap to make sure the audio can be synced
- [ ]  Press play on your teleprompter
- [ ]  Start speaking & recording your video
- [ ]  If you need to start over, then start over
- [ ]  Record until you’re done with the VSL
- [ ]  Press stop on your audio recorder / DAW
- [ ]  Press stop on your camera

**Exporting To Laptop**  👩🏽‍💻

If you’re using your phone, you can simply **Airdrop** the footage to your laptop. If you’re using your camera, you’ll need an **SD card reader** if you don’t already have one. 

Here’s the steps:

1. Remove the SD card from your camera
2. Plug the SD card reader into your computer
3. Plug the SD card into the SD card reader 
4. Open the SD card reader device on your computer 
5. Copy the footage over onto your laptop / computer

I’d recommend getting an **external hard drive** to store your footage on too, because you’ll end up with a tonne of footage blocking up your laptop storage. 

This is especially important if you’re **editing videos yourself**, because you’ll end up with huge libraries created by your editing software. 

Even if you’re not editing, you’re going to use a **tonne of storage** so I’d just get one. 

![Screen Shot 2024-07-15 at 1.50.55 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccc834a8-e8b6-4040-8995-e8d35845639f/78dd50ab-83a3-44de-ab84-e5312a7b60b7/Screen_Shot_2024-07-15_at_1.50.55_PM.png)

If you get a **16TB drive**, you’ll never really have to worry about this. So just get a drive with a **massive amount of storage** and save everything on that. 

**Phone Recording 🤳**

You can also record videos with your **phone.** I often record iPhone videos as a **supplement** **to camera quality videos just to **add some variety** to my VSL and test additional formats. 

If you’re **really on a budget**, you can do smartphone videos only, that’s fine. 

However, if you do this you **MUST** get a lavelier microphone to plug into your phone because otherwise the quality won’t be great. You’ll need ****a **lightning cable adaptor** if you have an iPhone. 

You should also get a **tripod** you can set your phone up on. I’ve linked a phone tripod in the [The Gear List](https://www.notion.so/The-Gear-List-e12710755fbe4ab0979bbec47a7c642f?pvs=21) that you can use for this. 

**Summary ✍️**

- The gear list has multiple options for multiple budgets.
- Script VSL word for word and use a teleprompter.
- Work on getting your face & eyes clear with lighting (watch YouTube videos).
- Spend some time learning how to reduce echo (watch YouTube videos).
- Get a good microphone (Shure SM7B with an audio interface or Shure MV7+).
- When you invest in a camera, the Sony a7c or FX3 are great options.
- Invest in a good lens (it will last you 10-20 years if you take care of it).
- Get a tripod with straight legs, not the bendy legs.
- Use Garageband or Logic Pro X to record your audio.
- Follow the simple above checklist when recording your videos.
- Export to your laptop using SD Card and SD Card reader.
- Suggest getting an external hard-drive for storage.
- No camera? You can use your iPhone to start with a Rode Lavelier Mic.

# Editing Your VSL

<aside>
<img src="/icons/laptop_green.svg" alt="/icons/laptop_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Editing & Uploading Your VSL**

In this video, we’re going to cover how to edit ****your VSL. You’ll see how to turn raw video footage into a final VSL, and insights on important topics like how to hire a video editor, what instructions to give your editor & how to upload the VSL to Wistia.

</aside>

**A Word Of Warning 🛑**

At first, focus more on **testing the copy** and less on **how the VSL looks**. 

****As long as:

1. Your **lighting** is good;
2. Your **audio** is clear; and
3. You **look** like a normal human…

Then you’re good to go. 

****Example →** https://www.hyperscalelabs.com/info 

**Video Editors  🎬 🧑🏻‍💻**

****When **hiring or looking for** a video editor, you have three main options:

1. Edit the VSL **yourself**; 
2. **Low-cost editor** in the Philippines; or
3. **Higher-quality** editor in the West. 

At first, I would suggest either **DIY** or an editor from **the Philippines**. 

You only need minimal editing, so it’s not an issue. Once you start scaling and you have a **formula that works**, invest in a more expensive, more skilled editor from the West (or Eastern Europe).

Then you can test a more polished, professional VSL with b-roll and music. 

Here’s a **job post** you can use to find an editor:
****

<aside>
<img src="/icons/briefcase_blue.svg" alt="/icons/briefcase_blue.svg" width="40px" /> **Editor For Talking Head Videos**

[Your Business Name] is a dynamic and innovative [education/consulting/coaching] business dedicated to helping [niche with outcome]. As we continue to expand, we are seeking a talented and creative Video Editor to join the [Your Business Name] team on a [casual/part-time/full-time] basis. 

**Position Overview:**

We are looking for an experienced Video Editor to join our creative team. The ideal candidate will have a proven track record of creating compelling and engaging video content, with a focus on talking head videos.

**Responsibilities:**

- Edit and assemble raw footage to create high-quality talking head videos
- Work closely with the marketing team to implement feedback and make necessary revisions to video content.
- Stay updated on industry trends and best practices to continually improve the quality of video content.

1. Full Name
2. Email Address
3. Where are you based
4. Link to your resume
5. Link to your portfolio
6. Do you have experience editing talking head videos?
7. What attracted you to apply for the role?

**Hiring Process 🤝** 

**I’d suggest posting on Upwork and OnlineJobs.ph.** You will be able to find decent video editors on both platforms. Just expect that, with OnlineJobs in particular, you will have to go through a lot of bad applications **to find someone good. 

Take some time with this and **find someone good**. Wait until you get 50-100 applications, review them, shortlist the best ones, then email them to set up an interview. Interview 5-10 people at least, and then trial the best 1-2 editors. 

**Then, trial them for a week or two (paid hourly work)**. ****If they do a good job, keep them. If they’re shit (work too slow/bad editing/unresponsive/etc.) then simply fire them **and repeat until you find someone who’s reliable, fast and does a good job.

**Instructions ✍️**

Once you’ve hired a video editor, send them **the following files** and **instructions**: 

1. .mp4 or .mov video clip(s) from your SD card for the VSL
2. .wav file(s) exported from your DAW / sound recorder
3. The script(s) you wrote for the VSL for their reference 

<aside>
📸 **Instructions For Editing The VSL**

**Files Provided:**

- The VSL file is named `ad1_video.mp4`
- The audio file is named `ad1_audio.wav`

**Editing Requirements:**

1. **Sync Audio:**
    - Ensure that the audio file is perfectly synced with the VSL video
    - There is a clap in the video that will allow you to sync the video and sound
2. **Video Format:**
    - The final video should be in a 16:9 aspect ratio
3. **Content Editing:**
    - Remove any mistakes from each video. Use zoom in and out techniques to cover up cuts, making the transitions smooth and seamless.
        - See [this video here](https://youtu.be/Vo1vQJn1niA?t=11) as an example. At 14s he zooms in to cover a transition. Then, he zooms back at at 37s to cover a transition again.
        - You can also use a “whoosh” sound effect + transition like in [this VSL here](https://www.hyperscalelabs.com/info) to cover any transitions or mistakes. Only use this at major transitions.
4. **Audio & Visuals:**
    - No music should be added to the video
        - OPTIONAL: Provide them with the audio + volume instructions

1. **Screenshots** 
    - Please add a screenshot of the following website at the time it’s mentioned. Flick through them quickly. They should be full-screen.
        - Provide timestamps and link to website
    - Please also add the client results to the VSL. These can show up next to me on the screen, not full screen. [See this example here (at 5:20).](https://www.hyperscalelabs.com/info)
        - Provide timestamps and links to the testimonial / result you want to add
2. **Captions:**
    - Please add captions to the video. [Again, see this example here.](https://www.hyperscalelabs.com/info)
        - Here is the script I used to record. Please check all the spelling here. Please triple check this. Do NOT submit with incorrect spelling: [LINK]
3. **Export:**
    - Export the final video in high-quality .mp4 format with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Please add the file to this drive folder **here**.
</aside>

**Adding Music 🎧**

Adding music is **100% optional**. It’s not going to make or break your VSL.

****You don’t need it and it can **distract** from the core message. I’ve seen many VSL scale to huge levels with **no music** and no background sound at all. That said, it can be a nice addition.

Obviously, there are exceptions. If you’re teaching **piano or guitar**, for example, it might make sense to have some background music. Just use your common sense here. 

For **B2B / B2Solopreneur coaching offers**, music is definitely not needed—keep it simple and to the point.  ****

**Adding B-Roll 🎥 📲**

Again, b-roll ****is **also optional**. ****We’ve seen VSL with b-roll work. We’ve seen VSL without b-roll work too. There’s no hard and fast rule here. 

Again, initially I would suggest **focusing on the copy** and look to polish your VSL up with heavy b-roll later as a split-test. Your VSL may not work initially & you have to test multiple versions.

If you decide to add b-roll, make sure it doesn’t distract from the **core message** of the VSL. If it makes the VSL more engaging and compelling, great—but don’t overdo it. 

**General Rule 👩‍⚖️**

The **more B2C** your offer is, the more heavy you can go on the **b-roll & music** for the direct VSL. If you’re B2B, it’s just not needed. Test it later if you want. 

**Uploading Your VSL ⬆️** 

Ok, the last step is to **upload your video to a hosting software**. ****Personally I recommend using Wistia, but it’s up to you which you use (Vimeo & Vidalytics are also decent options). 

**Summary ✍️**

- Focus on testing the VSL copy & iterating rather than perfecting video quality.
- Ensure the VSL is clear, well-lit, and has good audio to appear trustworthy.
- Consider editing the VSL yourself or hiring a low-cost editor from the Philippines initially.
- Post a detailed job ad for a video editor including responsibilities and requirements.
- Use platforms like Upwork and OnlineJobs.ph to find potential video editors.
- Review 50-100 applications, shortlist, and interview 5-10 candidates.
- Trial selected video editors for a week or two and retain only those who perform well.
- Provide clear instructions and files (video, audio, scripts) to your hired video editor.
- Export final videos in high-quality .mp4 format with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- Adding music and b-roll is optional; prioritize clear messaging and simple VSL initially.
- Test heavily edited version of winning VSL later to see if they outperform simpler versions.
- Upload VSL to Wistia so that it’s ready to embed into your funnel (will do this later).

# Building The Funnel

<aside>
<img src="/icons/hammer_green.svg" alt="/icons/hammer_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Building The Funnel** 

In this video, we’re going to cover how to build the VSL funnel. I’ll show you how to import our templates into your account, how to add your VSL, calendar and TY page video to the funnel, and how to publish your funnel on your domain. We’ll cover how to write the funnel copy in the next video.

</aside>

**Using Our Templates 📋**

Below this video, we’ll provide **templates for ClickFunnels 2.0** to import into your account. 

If you’re using **another tool** to build your funnels, like ClickFunnels 1.0, GoHighLevel, Kajabi, LeadPages, Convertri or any other funnel building software, you will have to **replicate the templates into your account** together as we go. 

Unfortunately, it’s **not possible** to make training on **every funnel builder** available on the market. 

So as I **break down each page** and show you **how it works**, simply **pause the video** and **build it in your funnel builder**. 

**Building Your Funnel 🔨**

Let’s **jump into ClickFunnels** and I’ll show you how to build the funnel. If you use another tool, that’s fine—just follow the exact same principles in your funnel builder. 

In this video, we’re going to go through the **tech setup** of the funnel. We’re going to specifically cover the following:

- How to embed the VSL onto the VSL page.
- How to embed Calendly into the booking page.
- How to setup your Calendly redirect.
- Changing the favicon to your logo.
- Publishing the pages on your domain / subdomain.

**Summary ✍️** 

- Import the relevant template into your account.
- Embed your final edited VSL onto the VSL page.
- Embed your Calendly form into the booking page.
- Setup Calendly to redirect to your TY page.
- Ensure your funnel is integrated with your email tool.
- Change the favicon to your logo.
- Publish the pages on your domain / subdomain.

# Funnel Copywriting

**Updates in progress (done by 7 March 2025)**

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_green.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Funnel Copywriting**

In this video, we’re going to cover how to write the copy for your VSL funnel. You’ll see a high-level overview of the funnel, how to write a killer opt-in page and how to build a great post booking TY page. Let’s get started.

</aside>

**Building Your Funnel 🔨**

Now that we’ve covered the tech setup of the funnel (importing templates, publishing pages, etc), we’re going to cover the **copywriting principles** behind the funnel. 

We’re going to specifically cover **the following**:

- How to write your opt-in page headline
- How to write your VSL page headline
- How to create your thank you page
- How to script your thank you page video

Let’s **jump into ClickFunnels** and I’ll show you how to write the copy in your funnel. 

**Headline Complex 📰**

The **headline complex** is the **topmost section** of your opt-in page. 

It consists of 3 parts:

1. The **pre-headline**
2. The **headline** 
3. The **sub-headline** 

The **diagram below** shows you each of these sections. 

![Product Diagrams.png](attachment:a2c8ccf4-eba1-42ab-befc-7b428f979e4e:231af9c9-30b8-4db2-a59c-d5387b977508.png)

The strength of your **headline complex** will have the **biggest impact** on the **conversion rate** of the page, so it’s important to **write a strong headline**. 

Let’s go through how to write **each section** of the headline complex now. 

**Pre-Headline ✍️**

First, your pre-headline should essentially **call out your target market**. You want to be **specific enough** here that **your market can identify** that the training is **for them**. 

You can also use this section to **disqualify** anyone that’s **not the right fit** for your program. 

So hypothetically, we could say: “Coaches, Consultants & Course Sellers Over $10,000/Month” if we wanted to **screen out anyone below that revenue level**. This is more relevant for **B2B offers**.

Be careful screening **too hard** here. If you try to go **too narrow**, you’re going to **reduce** your **conversion rate** significantly. Just clearly state a **description** of your avatar. 

Here’s **a few templates** you can use to write the pre-headline:

- 100% Free Training For [Customer Avatar]:
- 100% Free Training For [Customer Avatar] [Qualifiers]:
- 100% Free Training For [Customer Avatar] Reveals:
- [Avatar Identity #1], [Avatar Identity #2] and [Avatar Identity #3]:
- [Avatar Identity #1], [Avatar Identity #2] and [Avatar Identity #3] [Qualifiers]:
- Free Training For [Avatar] [Dealing With Specific Problem]:
- Free Training With [Credibility] Reveals:

**Headline ✍️**

Your headline is the single **most important component** of your opt-in page. 

A **good headline** will result in a **high conversion rate**. A **bad headline** will lead to a **low conversion rate**. The **other aspects** of the opt-in page are **significantly less important**.

Your headline needs to speak very directly to your market’s **goals, desires, fears, pain points and experiences with previous solutions** they’ve tried in the past. 

You should pull up the **VSL script** that we give you and your **Customer Avatar Worksheet** to write this headline. Below are **2 recommended templates** for your opt-in page headline. 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_orange.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_orange.svg" width="40px" /> **If you have a guarantee (ideal):** 

How To **[Get Specific Outcome]** In **[Timeframe]** Using **[Unique Mechanism]** Guaranteed Or You Don’t Pay.

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_orange.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_orange.svg" width="40px" /> **If you don’t have a guarantee (not ideal):** 

How To **[Get Specific Outcome]** In **[Timeframe]** Using **[Unique Mechanism]**

</aside>

Here are some **examples**:

- How to double your commissions in the next 6 months using “reverse selling”
- How to get your child to listen to you in the next 90 days using “low-demand parenting”
- How to make a full-time income online in the next 6 months as a breathwork instructor
- How to get a girlfriend in the next 90 days using 7 copy-paste tinder scripts
- How to get 50 hot seller leads in the next 90 days with my 4-step YouTube ad script

You want to make your headline sound **as push-button as possible**. The mechanism should **do the work for the prospect** and **make the process easier**. 

The mechanism should be something that’s **hot, trending, intriguing or exciting** to the prospect. You **don’t** want to **reference a boring commodity**. 

You should also aim to **reduce the perceived effort, time, energy, complexity and risk** the prospect will have to take in order to **get the outcome they want**. 

For example, a **bad headline** would be something like:

- How to double your commissions with sales roleplay & improving your sales process
- How to get more leads by improving your offer, funnels and Facebook advertising
- How to become a better marketer using my 900 hour training blueprint
- How to get a girlfriend by changing your personality and improving your hygiene
- How to get more real estate leads doing 5-6 hours a day of cold outreach

Always use **simple language** and small words. If you’re using **long, complex words**, it’s going to **reduce your conversion rate**. 

The reason is 1) some people **won’t understand them**, and 2) longer words often **lack pinpoint clarity** and are more open for interpretation. 

You want to express yourself **extremely simply and clearly**. There should be **no doubt whatsoever** about what you’re trying to say. Aim to write at a 3rd grade level. 

When writing your headlines, you’ll need to keep in mind that Facebook has **compliance requirements**. Please watch [Ad Script Templates](https://www.notion.so/Ad-Script-Templates-0ace3aec72f745acbdfbeb14b7181902?pvs=21) for more information. 

If you’re in **niches that are more heavily scrutinized**, like make money online, investing, weight loss, sexuality, relationships and addiction, you will need to be **more careful** about the specific language you use. 

I’d recommend simply **writing your headline** based on the above templates, watching [Ad Script Templates](https://www.notion.so/Ad-Script-Templates-0ace3aec72f745acbdfbeb14b7181902?pvs=21) for compliance considerations, and **submitting your opt-in page** in the Skool group for review—we can help you with compliance there if needed. 

**Sub-Headline ✍️**

Finally, in your sub-headline you want to **attack potential objections and concerns** that your prospect might have to your service. 

The idea here is to **reassure prospects** that in order to achieve the outcome you’re promising, they won’t have to do things they **don’t want to do** or that **they’ve tried before** that didn’t work. 

In some instances, you can also put your **guarantee in the sub-headline**. Only do this if your **primary headline is very long** and it works better to **put your guarantee in the sub-headline**. 

**Example →** https://go.hyperscalelabs.com/opt-in-example-2 

To write the **sub-headline**, you should pull up your Customer Avatar Worksheet again and find **common concerns or objections** that your prospects have, and **solutions that they’ve tried before** and failed with. 

Then, **determine** which of those concerns, objections and solutions they **won’t have to deal with when they work with you**, and put them into your sub-headline. 

Below are **3 templates** you can use to write your sub-headline.

****Here are some **examples**:

- (Get a girlfriend) Even if you’re short, introverted or you have a strong accent
- (Get a girlfriend) Without approaching women on the street or risking rejection
- (Make money online) Without a lot of starting money, free time or any prior experience
- (Lose weight) Without counting calories, going to the gym or giving up foods you love
- (Get clients) Without posting content, hiring appointment setters or spamming DMs

It’s likely that, in the **VSL script we wrote for you**, there’s **a line like this** in the **opening page**. You can **find that line** and **adapt it** for use on your opt-in page.

**Thank You Video 🎥**

The **Thank You Page Video** is a short video that you put on the final page of the funnel (the thank you page). The **goal** of this video is to i**ncrease your show rate** to calls. 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_pink.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_pink.svg" width="40px" /> Ok, you did it! Congratulations! You’re one step closer to **[getting outcome]** and **[benefits]**. But first, please watch this video very, very closely, because there’s a few important things to do before your call to prepare. 

So the first thing is, please go to your email right now and add the event to your calendar. If you’re using Gmail, there will likely be an email in your inbox that says “Invitation from unknown sender”. You need to go into that email and click “I know the sender”. There’s an image of what this box looks like below this video. 

If you’re not using Gmail, you can skip this step. 

Once you’ve done that, go to your calendar and click the button that confirms you’re attending the call. You’ll see somewhere that asks if you’re attending – just click “Yes”. 

If we don’t see a confirmation, your call will have to be cancelled. The reason for this is because our calendar is extremely full and we need to make sure that there’s space for people who are actually going to attend the calls. 

So please pause the video and do that right now. 

Ok, awesome. Thanks for getting that done. 

The next thing you need to do to prepare is watch the training video in step 2 below. This video gives you a bit more detail the process that we’re going to work through together to get you **[outcome]** and **[benefits]** using **[mechanism]**.

Once you’ve seen that video, the last thing to do is to go down to step 3 and watch a few case studies from our clients. This is important, because you’ll see that we can actually deliver. We get results very consistently. And if you have specific questions about the process, a lot of them are answered in those videos.

And that’s everything you need to prepare for the call. 

Now at the time of your call, please make sure that you’re ready to go and that you’re in a quiet place. If you’re driving or you’re walking around in the mall or something, we’ll just politely ask to reschedule the call. Not because we’re being rude or anything, just because since we’re giving you our full attention, we just ask the same in return. 

Please also bring along any other decision makers that you’ll want to speak to. Anyone that could veto the decision to work with us and change your life needs to be there on the call so we can share all of the relevant information with everyone that needs to hear it. The last thing we want to do is be playing Chinese whispers and going back and forth and having things get lost in translation. 

So that’s it. We’re very excited to see you on the call. I promise this is going to change everything for you and finally get you **[outcome]** even if you’ve tried everything before and nothing has worked. 

†I know you’ve been given the run around, I know that you’ve been here before and I know you’re skeptical—but this time is going to be different, I promise. 

So go ahead, watch the training, watch some of the case study videos below, and we’ll see you on the call.

</aside>

****†I would only include the line about skepticism if you’re in a **very competitive market** that’s **extremely jaded**. For example, **make money online**, **coaches & consultants**, **eCommerce brands**, **health** and **relationships**. 

If you’re a **parenting coach or breathwork instructor coach** for example, I **wouldn’t say this**. 

Other than that, all you need to do is **edit the script above**, **record it**, do some **light editing** and then embed the video to the **thank you page** after the prospect schedules a call. 

**Pre-Call Assets 🎓**

The main **pre-call asset** you want to create is a **25-35 minute video** that **handles major objections** that you most often run into on **sales calls**. 

The idea here is that you want to **eliminate as many objections as you can** before the prospect jumps onto the call. The main thing you want to avoid is **having extremely long calls** where you need to **educate the prospect** on the process and **what you’ll be doing together**. 

There’s **2 ways** to approach creating this asset:

1. Creating an **educational video** that focuses on your unique mechanism and process.  
2. Creating a **“case study” video** that focuses on a result you achieved for a client. 

The educational video will go deeper into your **process and methodology** and (indirectly) **educate the prospect** on why it’s superior to other solutions. 

The case study will focus more on the **transformation you achieved for a specific client**. It will still mention **the process**, but it **won’t be the core focus** of the video. This style is **much easier to create** and recommended in most cases. 

If you are in a **very sophisticated market**, with a lot of competitors and **deeply skeptical prospects**, you should make an **educational video**. I’m specifically talking about niches like **make money online**, **coaches & consultants**, **eCommerce brands**, **weight loss** and **dating**.

If that’s not you, it’s **not likely** that your market is **super competitive**.

The more **mature**, **sophisticated** and **jaded** your market is, the **more important this asset is going to be** in your sales process. 

For example, in **our niche** (coaches & consultants) it’s **very important**. 

Our prospects are often using all kinds of **funnels**, from **webinar funnels** to **challenge funnels** to **lead magnets**, and we need to **persuade them** to use a **VSL call funnel**. 

Right now, we’re doing this education on our **sales calls**, but we’re working on assets to do this education **before the sales call**, to **reduce the length of our calls**, **increase the conversion rate** and make it **easier for sales reps to close** when we bring them on.

It’s also very important to have **strong pre-call assets** if you’re introducing a **new opportunity** to an **established market**, and the market **isn’t familiar with the opportunity** yet. 

For example, one of our clients teaches women how to **start a new career** as a **death doula** (i.e. an end of life carer). A lot of people **don’t know what a death doula is** and have **a lot of questions** about the process. 

So we need to **educate the prospect** on **what it is** and **why it’s beneficial**.

Another example would be if you’re selling to the **make money online market**, and you have discovered **a new way to make money**, like making **passive income from ATM machines**. 

In this situation, **the prospect will have a lot of questions**, like “how much does a machine cost?” and “how much can you make from each machine?” and “are they time-consuming to setup?”. 

Let’s say, though, you’re like one of our clients who helps **adoptive parents get their child’s behavior under control**. In this situation, **the market is far less sophisticated**. 

They **won’t need a massive amount of education** about the process. They won’t be **as skeptical of coaching programs** and **unique mechanisms** offered by marketers. 

In this situation, you should do the **case study video**. 

**If in doubt**, ask in the **Skool group** and we’ll tell you **which type of asset** you should make. 

**Pre-Call Homework 🎓**

On the **thank you page** of your funnel template, if you scroll down to **step 2**, you will notice that there’s a **placeholder** where you can add a video. 

What you want to do here is get the prospect **closer to a buying decision**. 

Our goal is to **build trust**, **educate the prospect on your process** and show them that you can **deliver the outcome** that they’re looking to get in their life. 

What’s really important to note here is that you **do NOT** want to **talk about the specific features and deliverables** of your program. You also **do NOT** want to **reveal the price** of your program.

So we’re **NOT** going into the fact that you have **X number of coaching calls** a week, telling them that you’ve created an **incredible learning curriculum**, talking about your **certification**, etc. 

You want to essentially make an **educational content piece** or a **case study** that **educates them on the steps** you’re going to walk through with them to **get the results they want**.

**Competitive Markets 🛒**

If you’re in a **very competitive market**, you’re going to need to be **a bit more persuasive** and hammer the prospect’s false beliefs. 

I consider **the following markets** very competitive:

- Make money online
- Coaches & consultants
- eCommerce
- Some agency niches
- Weight loss
- Some dating niches

If you’re **not in one of these markets**, your market probably **isn’t that competitive**. You can just do either an **educational piece** or you can do a **case study video**. 

Remember, if you offer people something they’ve **tried before**, they will be **less likely to buy** your program. You need to **position yourself away** from your competitors. 

So you want to **explain why your process is different** from your competitors’ methods, and why you’re going to **get them results** where **everything else has failed**. 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/drafts_green.svg" alt="/icons/drafts_green.svg" width="40px" />

**Step #1 →** Re-state your big promise 

**Step #2 →** Introduce mechanism or process

# Email Automations

**Updates in progress (done by 7 March 2025)**

<aside>
<img src="/icons/mail_green.svg" alt="/icons/mail_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Email Automations**

In this video, I’m going to show you how to setup your email sequences for the VSL call funnel. You’ll get access to my email sequence templates that you can import into your account. I’ll also walk you through how the sequences work and how to set everything up in your autoresponder correctly.

</aside>

**Introduction 🎬**

In this video, we’re going to cover **2 major email automations** that you need in your funnel:

1. An **opt-in sequence**; and
2. A **booked automation**. ****

When someone **opts in** to your funnel, they **may not watch your entire VSL immediately**. This can happen for any number of reasons: they got **distracted**, they had an important **meeting**, they were **at the mall** on their phone, and so on and so forth. 

To combat this, we want to send prospects **follow-up emails** to make sure they don’t fall through the cracks. Our goal is to essentially **plug any holes in our funnel**.

When you get this right, it will **increase your overall call booking rate** and **reduce the overall cost per booked call** (CPBC) of your ads. 

After the prospect **books a call**, we want to **remove them from this sequence** so they don’t kept getting **slammed with opt-in emails**, so we’ll also **create an automation for that**. 

**CRMs & Autoresponders 📨**

Many of you will be using **different tools** right now to send emails. As I’m sure you can understand, we **cannot create training** to cover **every possible tool** on the market. 

The training is going to focus on **ActiveCampaign**, which is the tool we use to send emails. 

If you **don’t currently have a CRM or autoresponder**, or if you’re **not particularly tech-savvy**, I’d suggest using **ActiveCampaign** to make things easier. 

There is a link below to **create an ActiveCampaign account**. 

**Click here to create an account →** https://www.activecampaign.com/ 

If you don’t have ActiveCampaign, don’t worry. Your CRM or autoresponder will have **the same or similar features** to ActiveCampaign, and you’ll be able to **achieve the same result**. 

If you’re not sure how to **replicate any of the steps that I show you** inside of your email software, I would suggest putting a prompt into **ChatGPT** or **Claude** that’s something like this:

”What’s the equivalent feature to ActiveCampaign’s [feature] in [your tool]?”

“You know how in ActiveCampaign you can [do task]? How can I do this in [your tool]?”

You should get a pretty decent response. You can also do a **Google search** and you should be able to **find the documentation from the company** that walks you through the **setup process**. 

For example, if I ask AI, **“what is the equivalent feature to ActiveCampaign lists in Mailchimp?”** it will tell me that the equivalent feature is **“Audiences”**. 

I can then search **“How to create Audiences in Mailchimp”** and I will find Mailchimp’s documentation on how to create an audience. 

Overall, you’ll just need to be **proactive** here and figure out how to **apply what I’m teaching you** in this training **to your email software**. 

**Lists & Tags 📋**

Before creating your automations, we need to setup **“Lists”** in ActiveCampaign. These are **“contact lists”** that ActiveCampaign uses to **store & categorize your contacts**. 

In **your CRM or autoresponder**, this may be called **another name**. You will have to find the equivalent feature in your tool. Again, I’d suggest asking **ChatGPT or Claude** for this information. 

In this video, we’re going to be creating 3 lists:

1. A **VSL Opt-Ins** list
2. A **Booked Calls** list
3. A **Newsletter** list

We’re also going to create **“tags”** for no shows and shows. 

Tags can be thought of as **subcategories**. So we’re essentially going to **subcategorize** the **booked calls list** into people who **showed for their call** and **people who didn’t show up**. 

Let’s **jump into ActiveCampaign** now and I’ll show you **how to set this up**.

**ClickFunnels Integration 🔗**

Next up, we’ll need to **integrate your ActiveCampaign** (or whatever email autoresponder you’re using) account **with ClickFunnels**. 

We’re doing this so **ClickFunnels can communicate with ActiveCampaign**. When someone opts in to the funnel, ClickFunnels will **add the person to the VSL Opt-Ins list** in ActiveCampaign. 

****Again, if you’re **not using ClickFunnels**, you’ll need to figure out how to **integrate ActiveCampaign** or whatever tool you use **to your funnel builder**. ChatGPT will be helpful here. 

Let’s **jump into ClickFunnels now**, and I’ll show you how to **integrate ActiveCampaign**. 

**Calendly Integration 📆**

Next up, we’ll need to **integrate your ActiveCampaign** (or whatever email autoresponder you’re using) **account with Calendly**. 

We’re doing this so **Calendly can communicate with ActiveCampaign**. When someone **books a call in your calendar**, Calendly will send the **new contact data** to ActiveCampaign. 

Again, if you’re **not using Calendly**, you’ll need to **figure out** how to integrate **ActiveCampaign** or whatever tool it is that you use to your **calendar tool**. ChatGPT will also be helpful here. 

Let’s **jump into ActiveCampaign now**, and I’ll show you how to **integrate Calendly**. 

**Email Deliverability 📬**

In order for your email sequence **to work**, your emails have to actually **hit the inbox**. 

If your emails are going to **spam** (or the **promotions tab**), it doesn’t matter how good they are, **no-one will see them** and therefore no-one will open them. Simple logic here. 

So there’s **4 steps** that we need to take to get our emails **hitting the primary tab**:
****

1. Having a dedicated domain(s) for marketing emails (aged 30 days). 
2. Having a separate domain for your automations & newsletter.
3. Setting up your SPF, DKIM and DMARC records ([ActiveCampaign](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/206903370-SPF-DKIM-and-DMARC-Authentication#spf-dkim-and-dmarc-authentication-0-0)).

Let’s **walk through** each of these steps and show you **how to get them setup**.

**Opt-In Automation 📨**

If you **click the link below**, you can **import the automation** with the template emails above **into your ActiveCampaign account**. 

👉 **Import To ActiveCampaign →** [Click Here](https://tplshare.com/HifssRF)

If you’re **not currently using ActiveCampaign**, you will have to **copy the emails below**, **edit them** and **add them to your CRM or autoresponder**. 

You will also have to **setup an automation in your autoresponder** that **works the same way** as this automation. Let’s **jump over to ActiveCampaign now** and I’ll show you **how it works**.  

**Opt-In Sequence 📨**

Here’s the **structure** that we’ll be using for the **opt-in sequence** for your VSL funnel:

**Email #1 (Immediately) →** Access + PS

**Email #2 (+3 hours) →** Reminder 

**Email #3 (+21 hours) →** Checking in 

**Email #4 (+1 day) →** Direct offer #1

**Email #5 (+1 day) →** Offer Reminder

**Email #6 (+1 day) →** Testimonial #1

**Email #7 (+1 day) →** Testimonial #2

**Email #8 (+1 day) →** Testimonial #3

**Email #9 (+1 day) →** Content #1

**Email #10 (+1 day) →** Content #2

**Email #11 (+1 day) →** Content #3

**Email #12 (+1 day) →** Content #4

A **common concern** I hear with this is “is this too many emails?” 

The short answer is **no**. 

In general, the **more emails** you send the **more calls** you will book. Just **trust me on this**. 

I have **written out the full sequence below** for you to **copy into your autoresponder**. In the next section, I’ll also show you how to **import the sequence** **into ActiveCampaign automatically**. 

The emails provided are **the emails we use for Client Control**. Obviously they are **designed for our business**, so you will have to **edit them** so they’re relevant for your business.

All you have to do is copy & paste it into your business…

And if you don’t get at least 30 high-ticket clients in the next 6 months…

YOU DON’T PAY. 

Keep reading below and I’ll show you…

#1 - How this works
#2 - Proof that it works 

First off, how it works…

Over the last 6 years I’ve been in the trenches building and scaling coaching & consulting offers with paid traffic. 

I’ve spent millions for my high-profile clients (very profitably) and I’ve also scaled my own funnel to 306k/mo using nothing but YouTube ads. 

Over this time, I’ve developed a ridiculously effective 7-step YouTube ad script. 

And I’ve tested it in dozens of niches and industries and proven that it’s reliable, repeatable and works for anyone. 

All you have to do is:

1. Customize it for your niche 
2. Record the video
3. Launch it on YouTube

And watch as a parade of leads, appointments and clients march their way into your business—consistently and predictably. 

I’ve seen it over and over and over again…

**Alex Yellachich** used it to scale his B2C Amazon FBA coaching business from <10k/month to over 100k/mo in less than 5 months…

**Doni Brown** used it to scale her Beauty Boss education program from around 22k/mo to over 300k/mo in under 3 months… 

**Nicholas Infante** from the Doulagivers Institute used it to double revenue for his “end of life carer” certification program from 80k/mo to over 170k/mo in 6 months… 

**Johannes Egberts** used it to add an extra 60k/mo in cash collected to his breathwork coaching business in a little under 9 months… 

**Zane Bacic** used it to go from a 30k/mo business that was almost breaking even to a hyper-profitable coaching business spitting out 87k/mo… 

And the list goes on and on and on…

I’ve also personally spent 487k of my own money testing this ad script and generated 2.2 million in sales back (reaching 306k/mo at the peak of this campaign).

Bottom line is: it works. 

Which is why if you plug it into your business and you don’t get AT LEAST 30 high-ticket clients in the next 6 months, you don’t pay. 

So if you want more info on how this all works…

****And as I mentioned above, if this doesn’t work… you don’t pay. So we have no incentive to pressure you into anything you don’t want to do.

**Doni Brown** used it to scale her Beauty Boss education program from around 22k/mo to over 300k/mo in under 3 months… 

**Nicholas Infante** from the Doulagivers Institute used it to double revenue for his “end of life carer” certification program from 80k/mo to over 170k/mo in 6 months… 

**Johannes Egberts** used it to add an extra 60k/mo in cash collected to his breathwork coaching business in a little under 9 months… 

**Zane Bacic** used it to go from a 30k/mo business that was almost breaking even to a hyper-profitable coaching business spitting out 87k/mo… 

And the list goes on and on and on…

I’ve also personally spent 487k of my own money testing this ad script and generated 2.2 million in sales back (reaching 306k/mo at the peak of this campaign).

Bottom line is: it works. 

Which is why if you plug it into your business and you don’t get AT LEAST 30 high-ticket clients in the next 6 months, you don’t pay. 

So if you want more info on how this all works…

****And as I mentioned above, if this doesn’t work… you don’t pay. So we have no incentive to pressure you into anything you don’t want to do.

Question—is your revenue unpredictable?

One month you make 20k, then the next you make 6k…

The next month you make 12k, then the next you make 7k…

It’s like you’re trapped on a non-stop revenue rollercoaster…

You wake up stressed, you go to sleep stressed…

Your heart is constantly jackhammering in your chest, your shoulders are tight and you feel like you can’t breathe…

And it’s not like you’re being unreasonable, either… 

You don’t even feel the need to scale to multiple millions of dollars a year… 

All you really want is consistency.

Predictability.

Just 30-35k in reliable monthly revenue. 

*Is that too much to ask…?*

A chance to finally enjoy life after all your hard work, so you can work less and spend more time with your family and do the things that you love.

The answer is no—it’s NOT too much too ask. 

It is possible. 

And the formula is simple:

1. A high-ticket offer (positioned correctly)
2. A reliable ad funnel (NOT webinars or 30 minute VSLs)

That’s it. 

And that’s exactly what we did for Alex from Social Freedom.

We helped him plug our proven 7-step YouTube ad script and “direct video funnel” into his business…

And within a few short months he went from having a nightmare business with unpredictable revenue…

To a predictable, consistent, cash generation machine.

A DREAM business. 

Because instead of posting endless content on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook… 

And living in constant fear of the “algorithm”…

He now has an ad funnel that pulls people in and turns them into clients…

Month in, month out, like clockwork.

****%FIRSTNAME%,

It doesn’t matter how much money you make if you’re not acting with integrity. 

I’m talking about making promises to the market that are achievable…

And actually DELIVERING on those promises. 

That’s what we’re all about at Conversion Secrets. 

But a lot of people in this industry aren’t. 

Their motto is: “make money at any cost”

And I dunno about you…

But that just doesn’t sit right with me.

****Which is why we focus on BOTH in our YouTube ads coaching program… 

Results AND integrity. 

Helping you scale your business while staying in alignment with your core values and serving the market in a way that feels authentic to you…

That’s what we did for Dim. 

He came to us struggling with his coaching business (sitting under 5k a month in sales) and wanted help scaling…

But doing it in a way that felt authentic to him…

He wanted to work with someone that actually CARED about him and his business.

The result? 

He’s been able to scale his business to as high as 40k a month WITHOUT sacrificing his integrity (or doing anything that didn’t feel authentic to him). 

You can see it in the testimonial he left for us.

Want to scale to 100k/mo %FIRSTNAME%?

Here’s the secret… 

**Don’t be creative—just copy.**  

Take Sam Walton, for example, the founder of Walmart. 

He’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time and yet…

He copied other people. 

A TON. 

If you read his book Made In America (which is an incredible read) you’ll see that he was CONSTANTLY speaking with other merchants who had successful stores…

*And copying their most successful tactics.*

He copied their best discount strategies. 

The best ways to position products in a store. 

The best promotion strategies. 

The best operational structures. 

He copied and copied and copied. 

There’s no shame in copying.

It’s the quickest, easiest way to win. 

And if you want to scale your coaching business to 100k/mo, you should copy too. 

That’s exactly what my client Alex Yellachich did. 

He copied **exactly** what I did to scale to 306k/month. 

He copied: 

1. My proven funnels
2. My proven ad script 
3. My proven targeting settings

And scaled his Amazon FBA coaching business to 120k/month.

<img src="/icons/mail_green.svg" alt="/icons/mail_green.svg" width="40px" /> **SL →** My secret to 2.2 million in revenue

Hey %FIRSTNAME%, 

Want to know a marketing secret that will get you more clients? 

It’s not a funnel…

An ad platform…

Or even a sales script…

Just a simple “tweak” you can make to your marketing to double your leads, appointments and revenue very quickly (sometimes overnight)…

So you can have a bigger impact…

And more freedom in your life (i.e. more money with less time). 

So what is this secret? 

I call it “missing link marketing”. 

And, honestly… 

It’s not so much a secret as it is a law of the universe.

Because if you violate this universal law… 

It’s VERY hard to get clients to book calls into your calendar…

And even harder to get them to show up and buy your program. 

But if you follow this law… 

Getting calls & clients will become like pressing a “start button”. 

If you want to see how it works, I’ve put together a short YouTube video that explains what this secret is and how you can apply it to your marketing.

Because on YouTube…

**Booked Call Automation ☎️**

Now that the prospect has **scheduled a call**, we want to **remove them from the opt-in sequence**, so they **stop receiving these emails**. 

****👉 **Import To ActiveCampaign →** [Click Here](https://tplshare.com/w$wmW8b)

I’ll jump over to ActiveCampaign now and **show you how this automation works**. 

If you’re **not using ActiveCampaign**, please follow along closely and **replicate this automation** into your CRM or autoresponder. ChatGPT can help with instructions. 

**Booking Sequence 📨**

After the prospect books, you want to send them **at least 4-5 emails** to get them **warmed up** before the call, so that they come to the call **as far along in the sales process as possible**.

In an ideal world, the prospect would show up to the call and say: “Hey, **I’m just here to buy the program**, can you **take my card details** and we’ll get started?”. 

However, we **don’t want to reveal everything** about the program upfront. We still need to leave enough of an **information gap** for the prospect to be **curious and show up** to the call. 

In particular, you **don’t** want to **share the price** or the **deliverables**.

What you do want to provide more information on is:

1. The **process or strategy** you’ll be working through together; and
2. **Examples of clients** who have **achieved the results** that the prospect wants. 

I want to be very clear: you do **NOT** want to talk about the fact that you have **great coaches**, a lot of **support** or that you’ve spent **years building an amazing curriculum**. 

You **don’t** want to **talk about features** of the program. 

You want to talk about the **unique mechanisms**; the **strategies**, **tactics** and **methods** the prospect will be using **to get the result** that they’re looking for.

# Show Rate Systems

<aside>
<img src="/icons/chart-donut_green.svg" alt="/icons/chart-donut_green.svg" width="40px" /> **Welcome to Show Rate Systems**

In this video, we’ll cover the systems you should implement to ensure that you have a high show rate to your sales calls. Let’s get into it.

</aside>

**Show Rate KPIs 📈**

You want to aim for a **show rate** of **65% or more** on your sales calls. 

However, it’s important to **keep in mind** that **show rate isn’t everything**. 

It’s very possible to **increase your show rate** and see a **decrease in close rate**, because sometimes the no-shows are people that would have never bought anyway.  

If you have a **good cash ROI** and your show rate is **over 50%**, then you **shouldn’t spend too long** trying to **improve your show rate**. 

We’ll also cover below what to do if you have a **good cash ROI** but your show rate is **below 50%** (e.g. 40%) and you’re **struggling to increase it**, even after trying everything in this video.
****

**Show Rate Diagram 🗺**

Below is a **diagram** that shows you the **full system** that we use to get a **high show rate** on our sales calls. We currently have a **75%+ show rate** for Client Control. 

**Click here →** [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIX135rw=](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIX135rw=/?share_link_id=546350737944)

Let’s **walk through** the diagram now, and once we’ve covered it **at a high level**, we’ll go through **each component** of the system in **more detail**. 

**Thank You Page ✅**

You should have already created a **strong thank you page** using the training in the previous videos. If you haven’t, go back and **do that now**—it will help **increase your show rate**. 

**Manual Confirmation 📲

T**he most effective way to **immediately** **cut your no-show rate in half** is by **manually texting each prospect** who books in a call with a **confirmation message**.

You should aim to do this **as soon as you receive a notification** that a lead has booked in (or **as soon as you reasonably can**). 

It's a little bit of **manual work**, but it will **drastically improve your show-up rate**.

**Immediately** 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/notification_orange.svg" alt="/icons/notification_orange.svg" width="40px" />

Hey [TheirName], it’s [YourName] from [YourCompany]. *send*
I saw that you just booked a call with me on [day] at [time + timezone]. *send*
Can you please confirm this time works and the timezone is correct too? Thanks! *send*

</aside>

You want to **send each line one-by-one**. The reason for this is because it looks more like you’re an **actual person** (which you are) instead of a machine sending an **automated text**. 

If they **don’t respond after 24 hours**, send the **follow-up message** below. 

**Follow-Up (+24 Hours)**

<aside>
<img src="/icons/notification_orange.svg" alt="/icons/notification_orange.svg" width="40px" />

Hey [Name] haven’t heard back from you yet, are we still set for our call on [date] at [time + timezone]? Let me know. 

</aside>

Once they reply, just say **“Great, look forward to chatting then!”**  

When sending this message, you want to send it via **SMS or iMessage AND via WhatsApp**. 

So **check if the prospect has WhatsApp** first by going into WhatsApp and **entering their contact information**. WhatsApp will **tell you** if the prospect is a user. 

If the prospect does have WhatsApp then **send the message via both WhatsApp and either SMS or iMessage**. If they **don’t have WhatsApp**, send the message via **SMS or iMessage only**.

Note that it **doesn’t matter** if you send via iMessage or SMS. 

If you have an **iPhone** and the prospect has **iMessage** (you will know because their name turns blue) then of course send the message by iMessage, but if it’s **not possible** then send it via **SMS**. 

**Booking Sequence 📨**

The **email sequence** you send to a prospect **after they book a call** was covered in the previous video, called [Email Automations](https://www.notion.so/Email-Automations-3fc345d458ea49b0b957111b46c15881?pvs=21). 

You should have already **setup the automation** in your CRM or autoresponder and **customized the email sequence**.  

If you haven’t done that yet, **go back to that video** and **setup the automation**.

**Calendly Reminders 🔔**

In addition to these nurture emails, we also want to send out **SMS and email reminders** before the call to ensure the prospect is **aware that the call is coming up**. 

We want to have SMS and email reminders **go out**:

1. **24 hours** before the call
2. **1 hour** before the call 
3. **10 minutes** before the call

We covered how to set these up in [Calendly Setup](https://www.notion.so/Calendly-Setup-ed70c032c4274f02ba3366a566d71bd0?pvs=21). However, I will **jump into Calendly now** and **run through it again**, to show you how it works. 

**Double Dialling 📞**

At the time of your call, **join the zoom room** and **get ready for the call**. ****When you join the zoom call, **wait 4-5 minutes** for the prospect to show up. 

If they don’t show up, you want to **call the prospect manually**. 

If you are in **the same country** as the prospect, you can **do this on your phone**. If not, you can use **OpenPhone (US)** or a **Skype number (can get any country)** to do this. 

Open Calendly, get the prospect’s **phone number**, and **dial their number**. If the prospect does **NOT pick up the phone**, you want to dial them **AGAIN**. 

This is **very, very important**. Do **not** be **lazy** with this or be **afraid** to do this. 

A lot of people **won’t pick up** the phone **the first time** you call because they **don’t recognize the caller**. However, if you **dial twice**, they will generally **assume it’s an emergency** and they are **much more likely to pick up** the phone and ultimately close. 

If and when they **do pick up**, use the **script below** to get them **onto the zoom call**. 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/telephone_red.svg" alt="/icons/telephone_red.svg" width="40px" />

**Them:** “Hello?”

**You:** “Hi, am I speaking with **[Their Name]**?”

**Them:** “Yes”

**You:** “Hi **[Their Name]**, it’s **[Your Name]** here from **[Company]**. You booked a call with us to get help with **[Problem / Goal]**. Does that ring a bell?”

**Them:** “Oh yeah, that’s right”

**You:** “Great. I actually have the call in my calendar for right now. I’ll send over a zoom link to your email and your phone number right now and we can chat.”

==================================================

**A few important notes:** 

1. **If they give you objections, handle the objection.** 

The main objection they’re going to give is that they’re a bit busy now. Tell them it will be a short call, we’ll see if it’s a fit and if there’s not a fit we’ll jump off after 10 minutes and call it a day.  

2. **Reschedule only if absolutely necessary** 

If the prospect is really not able to take the call right now (say they’re at the mall or they’re driving), reschedule the call with them manually in Calendly. You should create another Calendly event that’s the exact same as your main Calendly event and use it for manually rescheduling calls. 

3. **Don’t ask if it’s a good time or ask for permission**

You don’t want to say things like, “Hey [Name] is now a good time?” or “Are you still able to do this time?” or “Does that work for you?” or anything like that. Remember, they scheduled the time and they’re the one who is flaking on their obligation. Don’t be passive and subservient here. You don’t want to make it any easier for them to reschedule on you than it has to be. Just assume that they’re going to get on the call and ONLY handle the objection IF they actively bring it up and ask for a new time. 

</aside>

**Nothing Worked 🤔**

If you’ve **tried everything this video** and **nothing** you’ve tried has managed to **improved your show rate**, then you have **a few options** remaining: 

1. If your **cash ROI is not in KPI**, then **shift your focus** to other areas of the funnel. 
2. If your **cash ROI is in KPI** but **show rate is 45-60%**, use the **volume method**.
3. If your **cash ROI is in KPI** but **show rate is <45%**, use the **Spirit Airlines Method**.

If your **cash ROI is out of KPI**, the goal is to **get your cash ROI into KPI** by **improving your ads, VSL, close rate or cash collection rate** instead of focusing on show rate. 

If your **cash ROI is in KPI**, the goal is to ensure that you and/or your sales reps are **still able to take 5-6 live calls per day**, **despite** having an average or even a **low show rate**. 

But if you have a **show rate of 40%**, and you **book 8 calls** into the calendar, you’re only going to be **taking around 3 live calls a day**. So you have **extra capacity we want to fill**. 

So let’s break down exactly **how to do that**. 

**The Airline Method ✈️**

Many ****airlines do something called **“IDBs”**. 

This is when a passenger is **“involuntarily denied boarding”** or, in other words, **turned away** at the gate **even though they wanted to board** the plane. 

The reason this happens is because **airlines overbook flights** to address **no-show passengers**. 

When passengers don’t show up, the flight is **at less than capacity**, which means a **paying customer** could have been **sitting in the seat**, which means **lost revenue**. 

To combat that, airlines will often **overbook flights**. 

If too many people show up, they will **refuse some passengers** (it’s in the terms) and if **two people** are booked into the **same seat**, they will **reassign one of them** to an empty seat. 

You can do the **same thing with your calendar**. 

However, Calendly **doesn’t support this functionality**. 

You will have to **setup a different scheduling software**, like Acuity for example, and **enable double or even triple booking**. 

**👉 Double booking in Acuity →** [Click here](https://help.acuityscheduling.com/hc/en-us/articles/16676952402957-Using-overlapping-appointments-and-double-booking-in-Acuity-Scheduling#:~:text=Acuity%20prevents%20double%20booking%20by,happen%20at%20any%20one%20time.)
****
At the time of your call, **join the call** with the **higher quality** prospect and **wait 3-4 minutes** for the prospect to show up. Make sure you **double dial** the prospect as outlined above. 

If the prospect **shows up** to the call, **ask for a moment** to send an important message. 

Make sure you **have a copy-paste message ready** asking the **other prospect** to **reschedule**. 

In the email, provide an **excuse** for why you can’t make the call, **apologize**, ask them to **reschedule** and provide a **link to your calendar**. 

If the prospect **doesn’t show up** after 3-4 minutes and after you **double dial** them, jump onto the **other zoom room** with the **lower quality prospect**. 

They **may already be there** waiting. If they’re not, you can **double dial** them too. 

Obviously this is a bit of a **juggling act**, but you will **get the hang of it**. 

You need to **strike a balance** of **waiting enough time** for the prospect to show up, but **not waiting too long** to lose the other prospect if your **preferred prospect doesn’t show** and your **non-preferred prospect does**. 

However, this process will allow you and/or your sales reps to **take 5-6 live calls per day even if you have a low show rate**, simply by putting more calls into the calendar. 

**Summary ✍️** 

- Aim for a show rate of 65% or more but if your cash ROI is in KPI, lower show rates are ok.
- Review the show rate diagram provided above to understand how to increase show rate.
- You should have already built a strong thank you page, this will help increase show rates.
- Manually confirming appointments via SMS, iMessage and WhatsApp will improve show rate.
- The booking sequence setup in [Email Automations](https://www.notion.so/Email-Automations-3fc345d458ea49b0b957111b46c15881?pvs=21) will help improve show rates.
- Ensure that you have SMS and email reminders setup in Calendly to get prospects to show.
- If a prospect doesn’t show up, double dial them & try to get them onto the zoom call.
- If none of this works, determine whether you’re in or out of KPI and choose your next step.
- If you’re out of KPI, I would recommend focusing on other areas of the funnel to get into KPI.
- If you’re in KPI, you can elect to simply book a higher volume of appointments (e.g. 9 per day)
- If you’re in KPI, you can also use the “Airline Method” to double & triple book your slots.

In this video, we’re going to cover how to choose a traffic source to drive leads to your  VSL funnel. Let’s get started.

</aside>

**Choosing Your Traffic Source 🚦**

In 99% of cases, you should be starting with **Facebook ads** to validate your offer. 

If you are **already at $50k+/month** with Facebook ads, you can **add in YouTube ads** to scale further. Otherwise, you should be starting with Facebook and validating your offer there. 

If in doubt, **ask in Skool**—but most of you should **go to the Facebook ads section now**. 

**What About YouTube** 🤔

We will get to it and scale you to **multiple 7 figures** with YouTube BUT I would **strongly recommend against starting with YouTube** to validate your funnel.  

Facebook is **easier to get working** and **works more consistently** than YouTube. I personally love running ads on YouTube. I like it more than Facebook. However, it is **more challenging** and **you don’t need it** to get to $50k/month for example. 

You’re much better off **starting with Facebook** and getting some initial traction there (~$50k/month in sales) before moving to YouTube.

So from here, **start working through the Facebook ads training** so you can get ready to launch your funnel on Facebook and **start bringing in some calls**. 

**Summary ✍️**

- In 99% of cases you should start with Facebook ads to validate your offer & funnel.
- From there, we can add in YouTube ads for additional scale, but start with Facebook.
